    <h2>Blueberry Pie Ingredients
    </h2>
    <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated blueberry pie recipe:

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sugar: </strong> This blueberry pie recipe starts with a cup of white sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Cornstarch: </strong> Cornstarch thickens the blueberry pie filling, preventing runniness.</li>
        <li><strong>Cinnamon: </strong>Ground cinnamon adds subtle warmth.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt: </strong>A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the blueberry pie filling, but it won't make it taste salty.</li>
        <li><strong>Blueberries: </strong>Of course, you'll need fresh blueberries! If you can't find fresh, frozen (and thawed) will work.</li>
        <li><strong>Pie crust: </strong>Use a store-bought or homemade pastry crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter: </strong>You'll need just a tablespoon of butter.</li>

    </ul>
